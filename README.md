## Background
This library is all about writing simple, readable and qualitative tests that focus on behavior 
instead of focussing on the technical implementation.
Many tests are coupled to the implementation because they use mocking and stubbing 
to have control over interactions between classes. This is something you often see in Solitary Unit Tests.

This library focusses on writing Sociable Unit Tests instead. A solitary unit test may look like an integration test,
but there is a big difference! A sociable unit test is still a unit test, only with a bigger unit!
The main advantage of writing sociable tests is that they are more robust! They can still be green after refactoring,
just because they aren't bound to the implementation.

There is still some mocking or stubbing available, but only for controlling interactions with external systems,
systems that are out of our control.
